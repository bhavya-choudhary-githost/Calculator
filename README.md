A basic calculator that takes two numbers and performs various mathematical operations.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The program returns the result.

## ➕ Supported Operations

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Logarithm (base 10)

## 💡 Notes

- Input is taken via the command line.
- Basic error handling included (e.g., divide by zero, invalid inputs).

## 🔧 Future Ideas

- Add exponentiation and square root
- Support multiple chained operations
- Add a GUI version with buttons
- Scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.)
- Graph plotting with matplotlib
- Expression parser (e.g., 2 + 3 * sin(45))

## 🛠 How to Run

```bash
python calculator.py
